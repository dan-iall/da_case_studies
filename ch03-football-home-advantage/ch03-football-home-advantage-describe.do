* SETTING UP DIRECTORIES

* STEP 1: set working directory for da_case_studies.
* for example:
* cd "C:/Users/xy/Dropbox/gabors_data_analysis/da_case_studies"

* STEP 2: * Directory for data
* Option 1: run directory-setting do file
do set-data-directory.do 
							/* this is a one-line do file that should sit in 
							the working directory you have just set up
							this do file has a global definition of your working directory
							more details: gabors-data-analysis.com/howto-stata/   */

* Option 2: set directory directly here
* for example:
* global data_dir "C:/Users/xy/gabors_data_analysis/da_data_repo"

global data_in  "$data_dir/football/clean"
global work  	"ch03-football-home-advantage"

cap mkdir 		"$work/output"
global output 	"$work/output"



* use full 11 season data table on games
use "$data_in\epl_games.dta", clear

* Or download directly from OSF:
/*
copy "https://osf.io/download/tyjp8/" "workfile.dta"
use "workfile.dta", clear
erase "workfile.dta"
*/ 

* sample design: keep one season
keep if season == 2016

* generate home goal advantage
gen home_goaladv = goals_home- goals_away
* generate direction of home goal advantage (negative - zero - positive)
gen home_goaldir = -1 if home_goaladv<0
 replace home_goaldir = 0 if home_goaladv==0
 replace home_goaldir = 1 if home_goaladv>0



* histogram
* Figure 3.9
colorpalette viridis, n(4) select(2) nograph

	plotregion(fcolor(white) ifcolor(white))

* statistics
* Table 3.7
* same as Table 3.9
